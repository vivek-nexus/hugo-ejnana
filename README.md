# User testing and analytics feedback
- Bottom navbar did not attract enough attention to click "Next snippet" button. This was clear in all the recordings as not a single visitor clicked on "Next snippet" button.
  - Changed bottom nav bar from sticking to the botton of the screen to floating slightly above and with higher elevation+bolder text
- People were specifically clicking on the snippet counter badge of cards on home screen and it was actually not clickable due to implementaion nuances
  - Changed implementation and made snipper counter badges clickable
